Ivy Applied Libraries Development Guide

Introduction
------------

Helping to contribute towards the ivy libraries requires a slightly more complex
setup than it is needed for contributing to ivy alone. For instance, `Ivy Robot`_ is
depending on `Mech`_, `Vision`_ and `Demo Utils`_. Thus, the related repositories
have to be pulled into the same local folder, and ???

To have a better grasp, let's look at an example on Ivy Robot in the next section!

Example - Ivy Robot
-------------------

**Directory Tree**

Due to dependencies, the related Ivy repositories have to be placed in the same
local folder:

.. code-block::

    |-- your-local-dir
    |   |-- ivy
    |   |-- mech
    |   |-- vision
    |   |-- robot
    |   |-- demo-utils

**Local Development**



**Docker Development**



**Round Up**

These examples should hopefully give you a good understanding of what is required
when developing on the Ivy applied libraries.
