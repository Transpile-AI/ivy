Volunteer Workflow
==================

We've created a promotion workflow to help you advance through the different tiers of contribution, from Contributor to Core Contributor, Rising Contributor, and finally, Top Contributor.

Refer Github Rewards for information about the badges.

Contributor
-----------
Start as a Contributor by earning any of the Initial Badges. It's straightforwardâ€”complete one of the simple tasks listed and you're in! This first step on your journey opens the door to becoming an integral part of our community.

Core Contributor
----------------
Attain Core Contributor status by securing any Bronze Badge. 

Rising Contributor
------------------
Ascend to the Rising Contributor level by acquiring a Silver Badge. This tier grants you access to our internal Discord channels and follow along with the internal meetings. You'll join our GitHub team, enabling you to directly commit changes, and modify issues. For those eager to lead, you can volunteer to be a liaison for Core Contributors and oversee PR reviews. As a Rising Contributor, you're encouraged to tackle complex tasks, pushing your skills to new heights.

Top Contributor
---------------
Achieve a Gold Badge to reach the peak of our program as a Top Contributor. This tier is for those who demonstrate exceptional dedication and expertise. You'll gain the privilege to engage with bounty-holding internal tasks and join our Bounty Program, where completing top-priority issues can earn you cash rewards ranging from $10 to $100. Once you've reached this level, we're honoured to offer you a personalised reference letter celebrating your achievements with Ivy.
