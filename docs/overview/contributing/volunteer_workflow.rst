Volunteer Workflow
==================

We've created a promotion workflow to help you advance through the different tiers of contribution, from Contributor to Core Contributor, Rising Contributor, and finally, Top Contributor.

Our promotion structure is based on our GitHub badge system. Check out `Github Rewards <contributing/github_rewards.rst>`_ for more information about them!

Contributor
-----------
Start as a Contributor by earning any of the Initial Badges. It's straightforwardâ€”complete one of the simple tasks listed and you're in! This first step on your journey opens the door to becoming an integral part of our community.

Core Contributor
----------------
Elevate to Core Contributor status by earning a Bronze Badge. As a Core Contributor, you're recognized not just for your skills but also for your growing commitment to our mission. You'll have the opportunity to engage more deeply with our projects and play an important role in shaping the future of our initiatives. This tier is a testament to your dedication and a stepping stone to even greater achievements within our community.

Rising Contributor
------------------
Ascend to the Rising Contributor level by acquiring a Silver Badge. This tier will allow you to be more deeply involved with our core group. You'll join our GitHub team, enabling you to directly commit changes, and modify issues.  As a Rising Contributor, you're encouraged to tackle complex tasks, pushing your skills to new heights.

Top Contributor
---------------
Achieve a Gold Badge to reach the peak of our program as a Top Contributor. This tier is for those who demonstrate exceptional dedication and expertise. You'll gain the privilege of engaging with bounty-holding internal tasks and join our Bounty Program, where completing top-priority issues can earn you cash rewards. Upon reaching this level, we will be delighted to acknowledge your contributions to Ivy with a special token of appreciation.
