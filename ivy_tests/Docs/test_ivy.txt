ivy_tests/Docs/test_ivy.txt
------------------------------------------------------------

The `ivy_tests/test_ivy` folder contains documentation related to testing Ivy, an open-source library for machine learning computations.

Folders in the `ivy_tests/test_ivy` directory:
------------------------------------------------
1. `ivy_tests/test_ivy/helpers`: 
   - This folder contains helper modules and utilities used in the Ivy testing framework. These helpers provide various functionalities to support the testing process.

2. `ivy_tests/test_ivy/test_frontends`:
   - This folder contains tests specifically designed to verify the functionality and compatibility of different frontends supported by Ivy. Frontends define the interface between Ivy and various machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and NumPy.

3. `ivy_tests/test_ivy/test_functional`:
   - This folder houses functional tests that validate the functionality and correctness of Ivy's core features. These tests cover a wide range of use cases and scenarios to ensure the stability and reliability of Ivy's functionalities.

4. `ivy_tests/test_ivy/test_misc`:
   - This folder contains miscellaneous tests that do not fall under the categories of frontend or functional tests. These tests cover specific aspects of Ivy, such as exception handling, logging, or specific edge cases.

5. `ivy_tests/test_ivy/test_stateful`:
   - This folder includes stateful tests that assess the behavior and correctness of Ivy's stateful operations and modules. These tests typically involve sequential computations or operations that depend on previous states.

Files in the `ivy_tests/test_ivy` directory:
--------------------------------------------
1. `ivy_tests/test_ivy/__init__.py`:
   - This is an empty Python file that indicates the folder is a Python package.

2. `ivy_tests/test_ivy/conftest.py`:
   - This file contains configuration settings and fixtures used by the Ivy testing framework. It provides setup and teardown functionalities for the tests within the `ivy_tests/test_ivy` directory.
